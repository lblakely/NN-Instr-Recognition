# NN-Instr-Recognition
Project to recognize short .wav samples of a violin versus a trumpet using a neural network 
Fall/Winter 2016/2017

This project was the final capstone project for the New Beginnings accerated post-bac program.  The project is implemented in C.  The base neural network code and the fast-fourier transform code are not mine and are cited in the code files.  The remainder of the code is my own work.  Please keep in mind this was my first encounter with neural networks, as well as my first coding project.
